#Project Description: YOLO v7-Based Workplace Surveillance System
This project leverages the advanced capabilities of the YOLO v7 model to enhance workplace security by detecting malicious recording and spying objects. The system is designed to identify potential threats such as mirrors, cameras, and phones placed near employee workstations. Additionally, it incorporates a face recognition module to monitor employee presence and detect any unauthorized individuals.

##Key Features:
###Malicious Object Detection:

Utilizes the YOLO v7 model for real-time detection of spying devices.
Identifies objects like mirrors, cameras, and phones that could be used for unauthorized recording or monitoring.
Ensures that these objects are detected if they are placed in view of the employeeâ€™s workstation.
###Employee Presence Verification:

Integrates face recognition software to verify the identity of individuals at workstations.
Detects whether an authorized employee is present and actively working.
Identifies and alerts security personnel if an unknown person is observed near the workstation or looking at the monitor.
###Enhanced Security:

Provides a comprehensive solution to mitigate the risks of industrial espionage and privacy breaches.
Helps maintain a secure and compliant workplace environment by preventing unauthorized surveillance.
Can be integrated with existing security systems for real-time monitoring and alerting.
###Real-Time Monitoring:

Employs high-speed image processing to deliver real-time detection and recognition results.
Ensures quick response times to potential security threats.
This project combines the powerful object detection capabilities of YOLO v7 with advanced facial recognition technology to create a robust system for safeguarding sensitive work environments. It aims to protect employees' privacy and prevent unauthorized access or surveillance within the workplace.
